This serious game is a non-linear interactive story made in Twine. The story explores issues of psychiatric medicine and mental illness. It is written from the point of view of an accutely mentally ill individual. The project encourages readers to donate to NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness).

This implementation is a prototype; only one story route is available. Users are encouraged to fork and contribute or modify the story as seen fit.
